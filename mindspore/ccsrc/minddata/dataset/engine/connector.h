// Connector is a communication data structure between two group of threads that
// preserve the order.
//
// Example use case:
// An initial tasks-list of [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] with 5 threads getting/processing elements from that list,
// and pushing the processed elements to a Connector in any order whoever finishes processing first.
// If the consumer of the Connector is single threaded, when the consumer pop() the
// element from the Connector one by one, it will get [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9].
//
// Requirements:
//   1. Each thread in the group of consumer or producer threads must be assigned ids starting from 0.
//   2. If your multi-threads program is not reading from a Connector class but
//      want to push to a Connector class, you must follow roundrobin element distribution,
//      i.e., the thread-id0 must have the first element, thread-id1 has the second element,
//      and so on; then each of this worker can push to the Connector class async in parallel.
//
// Blocking conditions:
//   1. Connector.push(int, T) can block when the internal queue it's trying to push is full.
//   2. Connector.pop(int) can block when
//        - The internal queue it's trying to pop is empty.
//        - The caller thread of pop() is not equal to the _expectConsumer. This is to enforce
//          the ordering.
//
// Future improvement:
//   1. Fault tolerant: Right now, if one of the worker dies, the Connector will not work
//      properly.
