This module provides APIs to load and process various common datasets such as MNIST,
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, VOC, COCO, ImageNet, CelebA, CLUE, etc. It also supports datasets
in standard format, including MindRecord, TFRecord, Manifest, etc. Users can also define
their own datasets with this module.

Besides, this module provides APIs to sample data while loading.

We can enable cache in most of the dataset with its key arguments 'cache'. Please notice that cache is not supported
on Windows platform yet. Do not use it while loading and processing data on Windows. More introductions and limitations
can refer `Single-Node Tensor Cache <https://www.mindspore.cn/tutorials/experts/en/r1.7/dataset/cache.html>`_.

Common imported modules in corresponding API examples are as follows:

.. code-block::

    import mindspore.dataset as ds
    from mindspore.dataset.transforms import c_transforms


Descriptions of common dataset terms are as follows:

- Dataset, the base class of all the datasets. It provides data processing methods to help preprocess the data.
- SourceDataset, an abstract class to represent the source of dataset pipeline which produces data from data
  sources such as files and databases.
- MappableDataset, an abstract class to represent a source dataset which supports for random access.
- Iterator, the base class of dataset iterator for enumerating elements.
