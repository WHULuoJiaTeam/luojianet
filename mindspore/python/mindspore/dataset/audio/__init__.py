This module is to support audio augmentations.
It includes two parts: transforms and utils.
transforms is a high performance processing module with common audio operations.
utils provides some general methods for audio processing.

Common imported modules in corresponding API examples are as follows:

.. code-block::

    import mindspore.dataset as ds
    import mindspore.dataset.audio.transforms as audio

Descriptions of common data processing terms are as follows:

- TensorOperation, the base class of all data processing operations implemented in C++.
- AudioTensorOperation, the base class of all audio processing operations. It is a derived class of TensorOperation.
