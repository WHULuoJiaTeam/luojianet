This module is to support common augmentations. C_transforms is a high performance
augmentation module which is developed by C++. Py_transforms provides an optional
implementation which is developed by Python & NumPy.

Common imported modules in corresponding API examples are as follows:

.. code-block::

    import mindspore.dataset as ds
    import mindspore.dataset.vision.c_transforms as c_vision
    import mindspore.dataset.vision.py_transforms as py_vision
    from mindspore.dataset.transforms import c_transforms
    from mindspore.dataset.transforms import py_transforms

Descriptions of common data processing terms are as follows:

- TensorOperation, the base class of all data processing operations implemented in C++.
- PyTensorOperation, the base class of all data processing operations implemented in Python.
