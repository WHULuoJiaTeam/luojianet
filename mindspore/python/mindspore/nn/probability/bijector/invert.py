class Invert(Bijector):

    Invert Bijector. Compute the inverse function of the input bijector.

    Args:
        bijector (Bijector): Base Bijector.
        name (str): The name of the Bijector. Default: "". When name is set to "", it is actually
            'Invert' + bijector.name.

    Supported Platforms:
        ``Ascend`` ``GPU``

    Examples:
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> import mindspore
        >>> import mindspore.nn as nn
