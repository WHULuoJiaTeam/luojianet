/*
 * <FUNCTION DESCRIPTION>
 *    The fscanf_s function is equivalent to fscanf except that the c, s,
 *    and [ conversion specifiers apply to a pair of arguments (unless assignment suppression is indicated by a*)
 *    The fscanf function reads data from the current position of stream into
 *    the locations given by argument (if any). Each argument must be a pointer
 *    to a variable of a type that corresponds to a type specifier in format.
 *    format controls the interpretation of the input fields and has the same
 *    form and function as the format argument for scanf.
 *
 * <INPUT PARAMETERS>
 *    stream              Pointer to FILE structure.
 *    format              Format control string, see Format Specifications.
 *    ...                 Optional arguments.
 *
 * <OUTPUT PARAMETERS>
 *    ...                 The convered value stored in user assigned address
 *
 * <RETURN VALUE>
 *    Each of these functions returns the number of fields successfully converted
 *    and assigned; the return value does not include fields that were read but
 *    not assigned. A return value of 0 indicates that no fields were assigned.
 *    return -1 if an error occurs.
